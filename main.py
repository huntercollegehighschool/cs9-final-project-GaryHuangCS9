It's so big you can hardly wrap your hand around it and you have to use 2 hands. Why in the world would the school have this? What could they possibly use it for? You turn it on, and in the back of your mind you hear 'Let there be light!' It illuminates the room entirely, bathing it in white. You can feel the heat emanating from the flashlight. It feels warm and comforting for some reason. Seriously, why would the school even need this? The zombies claw at their eyes, screaming and writhing in pain. They shut their eyes, cover them, roll on the floor, nothing helps. The damage has already been done. The zombies all convulse violently and fall to the floor, dead for good. You walk around the school and get rid of the rest of the zombies. You do the same to all other parts of the neighborhood, and eventually you decide to go around the country to exterminate all of the zombies. You're just someone with a flashlight and a dream. You don't know if you can really get rid of all zombies for good, but you have to try. Finally, after 3 long years, you succeed, and you're recognized as a national hero by the government.

Right as they're about to reach you, you lift the flute up to your lips and blow into it as hard as you can. The zombies recoil back, realizing that you are the predator now, not them. They begin to communicate amongst each other through a series of grunts and groans. After what seems to be a heated debate, the majority of the zombies kneel before you. The few that remain standing number only between 20 and 30 zombies. They grunt and groan and gesture, probably saying something about freedom and eating. The zombies kneeling turn to look at them, then back to you. They look back at the disobedient zombies and rise. You aren't sure why but you have a feeling that you should raise the flute to your lips. You blow into it and the command is clear: kill all insubordinate zombies. The obedient ones follow the order, tearing at the disobedient ones with the same level of savagery they showed to the humans. The rebels try to fight back but it's no use; there are too many zombies on your side and they overpower them easily. When the deed is done, the obedient ones bow before you and the almighty power of the flute which you possess. You walk out of the school with the zombies following you like the slaves they've become. First stop, the debt collector's office. Along the way, you pick up a laser pointer that happened to be lying on the ground so that you could more easily tell the zombies what their target is. When you arrive, you shine the laser at the door, and with a single whistle, you command the zombies to break it down. You go room to room, checking for any surviving victims—I mean employees. There are barely any. Most probably ran away at first sight of the zombies. However, when you get to the final room—the chairman's office—on the top floor, it is barricaded. Rather heavily, might I add. Nothing you can't handle, though. You shine the laser at the door. All of the zombies turn towards it, and on your command, they act as an unstoppable current, crashing against the entrance and breaking through. You step into the room, and there he is, hiding under his desk: the chairman. You are silent as you approach him. There's really nothing to say. You're here to kill him, plain and simple. He begs you to spare his life, but when he looks into your eyes, he sees nothing staring back at him, a gaze even colder than the zombies'. You shine the laser at his head, right between the eyes. And with a single, swift whistle, he dies. You have now finished your revenge. So what will you do now? In this ravaged world, how can one go back to how things used to be? The horror of the zombie apocalypse will be etched into the minds of all who witnessed it, and seared into the minds of those who experienced it. The world now has to change and move on. But it can't do it alone. It needs a leader to step up in this time of anarchy and distrust. Someone has to guide the world into its future and towards success. Only you have the power and resources to do it, but the choice is up to you.")

You tell the world your dream of building a better future for all of humanity, and of ushering an era of peace. You mean no harm, and only want to help the people. You post the video online and wait for the world's response. A day later, you hear a very loud sound, above you, followed by a high pitched whistling that seems to get louder. You look up, and you see a tiny little dot in the sky. It looks like it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger, until you realize that it's 10 seconds away from falling right on your head. Why does it look so much like a—it is! It's a bomb! Oh wait....You start running with the zombies following you close behind.

Your reputation grows, and you become known as the zombie king. Eventually, you go around the world and ravage it the same way you ravaged America. Of course, there is the slight issue of a resistance being built up to combat your efforts to kill and destroy. All major superpowers in the world came together after you destroyed America, quite easily as well, too. It's really a shame. After years of turmoil and war, the world is finally unified to face a common enemy, but there's no way they can beat you. You have a literal army of zombies that can topple buildings and destroy nations easy. After 10 long, annoying years, the resistance is finally put down, the majority of humanity exterminated, and the world in complete ruins. And then you ask yourself the same question you asked all those years ago: so what now? You're the last human alive with an army of obedient zombies that will go wherever you go, but now there's nothing to do. There's no more world to destroy out of boredom. Well, might as well go home. You find your way back to America, back to the neighborhood where you grew up, back to the only place you called home. You feel tired so you go to bed. When you wake up, you feel hungry, so you open the refridgerator and grab a slice of pizza and a half empty bottle of water. It's been 10 years since you touched this stuff so it's probably expired, but you're hungry and beggars can't be choosers. Plus, you're a human who wiped out all of humanity besides yourself. All your sanity has probably gone down the drain already. You eat the expired food and drink the contaminated water. A few minutes later, you have to go to the bathroom. You sit on the toilet and in a few minutes, the room smells really bad. Even the zombies leave you alone (Yes, the zombies did follow you into the bathroom. I said that they are obedient and would follow you wherever you go, didn't I?). You keel over in extreme pain, clutching your stomach hard.

How they turned into zombies you don't really care about, and you're too lazy to find out anyways.

Again, you tear down more walls, build up new ones, and put up some doors and windows. But this is still not enough room to accomodate all of the zombies. This is going to be a problem. You're going to have to use the entire neighborhood, and even that might not be enough. I guess you really can't act like the zombie apocalypse never happened. If you're not worrying about the complete chaos and state of anarchy the world is in, you're concerned about finding a place bloodthirsty zombies can call home. You continue renovating the buildings in your nieghborhood, and eventually you filled all of them. But there are still so many zombies remaining. You're going to have to start building homes now. From zombie apocalypse to SimCity, you expand your neighborhood, building home after home for the zombies. Surprisingly, the government doesn't interfere with your project. They must be too lazy to do so, or they just don't want to become a target of the zombies. Finally, after 10 long years, you have completed the homes for all the zombies. You don't know how much space you used, only that it is a lot. At this point, the world has gone back to normal, or as normal as it can be.

You leap at the alpha zombie, lifting the guitar high above your head, and slam it down on it, killing the alpha zombie with one shot....I'm joking. When you tried to slam the guitar down on him, it catches the guitar with one hand, leaving you dangling in front of it. The alpha zombie grunts and groans, as if it's trying to say something. It's hard to make out. Sounds like something along the lines of 'omae wa mou shindeiru.' 'What?', you say, both in shock that a zombie is trying to communicate with you and confusion about what it's trying to tell you (what does omae wa mou shindeiru even mean?).

It gradually gets bigger and bigger, until it covers the entire room. The smell gets even worse, too. The cloud becomes so big you can't see the zombies anymore. You pull out your flashlight to see where the zombies are at. You turn it on, and the room explodes. The acid must have been very explosive and turning on the flashlight must have made a spark that ignited the gas. Why the school even allowed highly explosive acid to remain in the classroom I have no idea, but it shouldn't really come as a shock since they are paying their employees $2 an hour.

'This is what was supposed to stop the zombies.' You now understand why he is crying. But then, you realize something. 'How would you know what the antidote for the zombies is?' you ask him. And then, he stops crying. He slowly looks up at you and his eyes are full of fear. 'If I tell you, do you promise to not abandon me?' he asks. You give him your word that you wouldn't.
